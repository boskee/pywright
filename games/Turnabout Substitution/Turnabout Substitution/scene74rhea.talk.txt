char Rhea
"And he had to know that{n}Erlenmeyer escaped from prison{n}before everyone else."

char Apollo hide
"Yeah. And that narrows down our{n}list considerably. Initially,{n}I suspected Paul Strings."

char Rhea
"Why?"

char Apollo hide
"Well, I thought it would make more{n}sense for him to break Erlenmeyer{n}out of jail to create an"
"opportunity to murder Judge than{n}just for "justice." And he had{n}that large bust in his office..."
"Of course, he was under police{n}surveillance the moment of the{n}crime."

"Yeah... and it actually{n}fits together.{n}Think about it:"
"Judge said she came back to the{n}country from the Virgin Islands{n}to prosecute Erlenmeyer."
"But what if she had come back long{n}before that, or never truly left?{n}Most people eventually forgot"
"about her, and those who didn't{n}thought she was in the{n}Virgin Islands."

char Rhea
"Of course! No one would suspect{n}her of the crimes."

char Apollo hide
"Exactly! And when Erlenmeyer{n}suddenly confessed to the crimes,{n}she reappeared to prosecute him."
"She took the case to ensure that{n}he would be sent to jail in her{n}place!"
"It could be the {sfx/Key.ogg}{c900}real reason{c} she{n}forged evidence to have him{n}convicted. She could have even"
"continued killing after Erlenmeyer{n}was in prison, as long as she{n}changed her m.o.!"

char Rhea
"Then, when she found out{n}Erlenmeyer broke out of prison,{n}she told him the police would be"
"looking for him!{n}I'm sure she knew Strings'{n}secret phone number..."
